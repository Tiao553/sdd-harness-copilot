spec_crew.py — SpecCrew: Hierarchical validation of architectural intent.

Crew topology (per docs/validate-crew-architecture.html):
  MGR  Spec Manager LLM   — Routes each section to the right specialist
  ARC  Data Architect      — Schema/medallion layer alignment vs DESIGN
  ENG  Data Engineer       — Pipeline spec, DAG logic, DEFINE requirements
  SWE  Software Engineer   — Code structure, patterns, API contracts

Process: CrewAI Process.hierarchical
Input:   ValidateContext (immutable, built by Orchestrator)
Output:  SpecReport (Pydantic-validated)

AgentSpec persona mapping:
  MGR → design-agent       (routes and classifies artifacts)
  ARC → medallion-architect (schema design, Bronze/Silver/Gold alignment)
  ENG → ai-data-engineer   (pipeline spec, DAG logic, data quality)
  SWE → code-reviewer      (code structure, patterns, maintainability)
